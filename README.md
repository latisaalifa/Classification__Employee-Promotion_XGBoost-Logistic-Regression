# Predicting Employee Promotion Decisions Using Machine Learning: A Comparison of XGBoost and Logistic Regression
## Background
The productivity of a company largely depends on employee performance in achieving the organization’s vision and mission. To accomplish this, effective human resource management (HRM) is essential to retain competent employees and minimize the level of employee attrition. High employee attrition is often associated with employee termination and replacement recruitment processes, which can lead to financial losses for the company.

Therefore, preventive efforts are needed by promoting high-performing employees to reduce the risk of attrition. In this context, prediction plays an important role in supporting promotion decision-making. This study applies two reliable machine learning methods, namely XGBoost and Logistic Regression. XGBoost is known for its ability to handle complex data and deliver high accuracy, while Logistic Regression is a simple and fast model with a low risk of overfitting.
## Bussines Understanding
Employee promotion is a crucial factor in maintaining work motivation and improving a company’s overall productivity. Conducting promotion decisions manually can lead to bias and inconsistency. When this occurs, it may result in high employee attrition, causing financial and operational losses for the company. Therefore, organizations need a data-driven approach to identify potential employees objectively, particularly by utilizing historical promotion data as a reference for decision-making. This approach enables the company to improve decision-making efficiency, enhance fairness in promotions, and reduce employee turnover. 
This project follows the CRISP-DM framework, which consists of several key stages: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. The modeling stage focuses on applying two algorithms, XGBoost and Logistic Regression to classify whether an employee is eligible for promotion. Model performance is then evaluated based on accuracy metrics to determine the best-performing model.
